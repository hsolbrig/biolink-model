# Slot: isa partof closure


Ancestors (reflexive) of the object field following is_a (subClassOf) and part-of links. This is typically used as a query constraint and for faceting. The combination of is_a and part of is a common pattern, and can be used in gene expression queries (finding genes that are expressed in a structure, a subtype, or a part of that structure) or in GO queries (in any of the three branches of GO)
